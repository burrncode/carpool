# carpool
Carpooling application in Laravel 5.1


Project Description
1. A simple responsive carpooling website using Laravel 5. 
2. Users should be able to login using Facebook (minimal system to track those user on our database).
3. A simple admin panel for me to control users and they journey they create.
4. User should be able to create journeys from location A to location B and specify number of seats they have. Number of seats should decrease and offer should close when 'offering person' approves the request.
5. Nothing fancy design but it has to be functional. I will test rigorously.
6. You should be available to work with me, rather than deliver the work at the end.
